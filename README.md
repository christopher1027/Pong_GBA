# Pong_GBA
Pong video game programmed in C for the Game Boy Advance

Description:
In a computer architecture class, I had to design and create my own video game using C which compiles to ARM assembly, and then can be supported on any Game Boy Advanced Emulator. 
The video game of choice was based off the famous Pong video game released in 1972.

Playing the Game:
To run the game, first you need to be compile gba.c and gba.h files to ARM assembly.
Then you will need to get a Game Boy Advanced Emulator of your choice and load the file into the emulator.
